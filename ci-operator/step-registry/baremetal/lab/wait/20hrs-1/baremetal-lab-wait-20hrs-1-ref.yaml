        This configures how long this step waits for in seconds.
  documentation: >-
    This step is used by the baremetal-lab manual workflows to just sleep for ${CLUSTER_DURATION} seconds and
    allow the manual tests to execute. This is a 'fork' of clusterbot-wait with the timeout value increased to 72h so that
    CLUSTER_DURATION larger than 4h can be defined.
